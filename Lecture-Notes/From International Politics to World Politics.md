- Main assumptions underlying the main rivals as theories of world politics:
    - Liberal internationalism
        - Developed after the First World War
        - Main themes: human beings and societies can be improved
            - **there can be progress in history**
        - Reject the realist notion that war is the natural condition of world politics
        - Cooperation is possible and beneficial
        - **Cooperation in the modern era is facilitated by interdependence, institutions, and democracy**
            - **Interdependence** between states is a critically important feature of world politics.
        - States motivated by more than questions of power
            - also concerned with social welfare
        - National interests in more than just military terms
        - Importance of economic, environmental, and technological issues.
        - “States may be legally sovereign, but in practice they have to negotiate with all sorts of other actors, with the result that their freedom to act as they might wish is seriously curtailed.”
    - Realism
        - Most venerable paradigm in international relations theory
        - History essentially does not change
            - always has been about the struggle for power
        - Military power the most important form of power
            - ultima ratio
        - The international system characterized by the distribution of power
            - unipolarity bipolarity, multipolarity
        - Hegemons
        - the main actors on the world stage are states, which are legally sovereign actors
            - multinational corporations or interna- tional organizations have to work within the frame- work of inter-state relations.
        - International politics (world politics), represents a struggle for power among states
            
            
            - trying to maximize its national interest
        - “Balance of power”: states act so as to prevent any one state from dominating
        - world politics is a self-help system
            - states must rely on their military resources to achieve their ends.
        - Neorealism
            - structure of the international system is important in affectibg the behaviour of all states
        - **Multipolarity 多极化**
            - after the cold war ends
        - The dystopian side
    - Social constructivism
        - Definition: '**a social group constructing things for one another, collaboratively creating a small culture of shared artefacts with shared meanings**
        - developed by the U.S.
        - late 1980s
        - “we make and remake the social world and so there is much more of a role for human agency than realism and liberalism allow.”
        - world politics system can be changed by human being
        - States act on the basis of what leaders and people believe
        - States develop their view of how the world is beliefs and how it should be values through social interaction
        - Identity, beliefs, and values determine the effects of the international system
        - In essence, international actors make their own reality
            - the world is “socially constructed”
    - Poststructuralism
        - mid-1980s
        - also referred to as postmodernism
        - “foundational epistemology”
        - Michel Foucault
            - Leading postmodernist
            - “Schools Serve **the Same Social Functions As Prisons and Mental Institutions**
             - to Define, Classify, Control, and Regulate People”
    - Post-colonialism and decolonialism
        - “whether Eurocentric theories can really purport to explain world politics as a whole, or world politics as it relates to the lives of most people on the planet”
        - “traditional Marxism did not pay sufficient attention to the way that racial and gendered identities and power relations were central to uphold- ing class power.”
    - Feminism
        - there are many kinds of feminisms
        - focus on the construc- tion of differences between ‘women’ and ‘men’ in the context of hierarchy and power and the highly contin- gent understandings of masculinity and femininity that these power relations produce.
        - “women are excluded from power and prevented from playing a full part in political activity”
            - how women have been restricted to roles critically important for the functioning of things
        - the cause of women’s inequality is to be found in the capitalist system; overthrowing capitalism is the necessary route for the achievement of the equal treatment of women.

## Meta-theoretical questions

- Consider the distinction between explanatory and constitutive theories.
    - Explanatory theory: one that sees the world as something external to our theories of it
    - Constitutive theory: one that thinks our theories actually help construct the world
- Relist and liberal theories tend to be explanatory
- Foundational: one that thinks that all truth claims (about some feature of the world) can be judged true or false.
- Anti-foundational: truth claims cannot be judged in this way, since there are never neutral grounds for doing so.

## Theories and globalization

- Globalization
    - Liberals: globalization is the end product of a long-running, progressive transformation of world politics.
        - increase interconnectedness among socities
        - Example: the British vote to exit from the EU was a foolish and very expensive decision to reject political and economic integration.
    - Realists: division of the world into nation-states.
        - Example: decision of the British people to leave the European Union as a demonstration of the enduring significance of national sovereignty.
    - Constructivitst theorists: an external force acting on states, which leaders often argue is a reality that they cannot chal- lenge.
    - Marxists: globalizations is a sham
        - Example: British people to retreat from transnational collabo-
        ration, voting to exit the EU, was because ordinary
        working people did not feel the benefits of it.
    - Poststructuralists: “globalization’ does not exist out
    there in the world.
    - Postcolonial and decolonial: highlights the important degree of continuity and persistence of colonial forms of power in the global- ized world.
    - Feminists:
        - Liberal feminists, are most positive and hopeful about globalization, viewing it as a way to incorporate more women into the existing political and economic system.
        - the negative effects of neoliberalism and economic globalization on the global wealth gap

    - A risk culture
    

- Negative

    - the global economy is something beyond our control.
    - globalization is
    very uneven in its effects.
        - globalization
        applies only to the developed world.
    - the latest stage of Western imperialism.
    - there are very consid-
    erable losers as the world becomes more globalized.

    - a set of assumptions about how the world works
- Theory
    - causal statement about what causes a phenomenon
    - “if x, then y”
- Hypothesis
    - using theory, making prediction about a concrete case

## The scientific method

1. original question
2. theory to explain the question
3. hypothesis:
    1. applying the theory to the question
4. observation of empirical data
5. analysis and re-evalution of the theory

## Problem with social scientific theories

- hard to do realistic experiments
- hard to measure key variables
    - social anger, resentment, fear
- bias of the investigator
    - what's a terrorist
    - what is a freedom fighter
- problem of free will
    - humans, like atoms, are reflexive
        - they may choose to act
    

## Marxism

- History is all about “class struggle”
    - Class is defined by control over “means of production” (wealth, resources)
- The states is controlled by class interests
- Leads to exploitation of the poor and the weak by the strong and wealthy
- **International politics is the external projection of class conflict**
- “World politics takes place in a highly unequal world capitalist economy.”
    - the most important actors are **not states but classes**

    - from 1945 to the end of the Cold War
- Japan
    - form 1990s/21 first century on
